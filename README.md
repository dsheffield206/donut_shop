// This is program estimates donut demand for TopPot's 5 store locations.
// We are using object contructors to create our Top Pot Locations
/* We will use the hours of operation, minimum & maximum # of customers, avg donut purchased per customer per hour and random numbers generated (within the min and max range) to estimate hourly donut demand. */
/* After generating an instance for each of the 5 TopPot Locations, we'll need to pass that information into a table and manipulate the DOM to display the results. */
// This project makes me hungry.
